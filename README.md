ISC is a SCP: SL exiled plugin that addes various silly SubClasses to the game without needing Exiled.CustomRoles

### SubClasses
| |  |
| --- | --- |
| Business man | a scientist that spawns in gr-18 that generates 1 coin every 30 seconds |
| Ghost | A Class-D with the ability to pass through doors for 20 seconds with a 90 second cooldown but also at the cost of slowed movement |
| ClassD informer | A classd who gets updates via a hint OR broadcast (config) of the warhead status, Foundation forces and scps that remain alive |
| JoeBiden | A guard that has slowed movement but enhanced firepower (yes him spawning in front of stairs was a intended feature) |
| Kid | A short classD with more stamina and can pick up 5 candies |
| Light Technician | A Guard with the ability to turn off lights in the room he is currently in for 20 seconds with a 120 second cooldown |
| SCP-1058 | A ClassD which possesses uncontrollable invisibility |
| SCP-999 | A friendly SCP that provides passive regeneration to nearby players, can pickup 20 pieces of candy, able to HEAR scps and slightly slowed movement |
| Site Costume Manager | A scientist that can disguise all people in the same room as him as scientists for a minute by pressing ALT (has a 2 minute cooldown) |
| Telekinetic Dboy | A ClassD that can Look at a door button and press alt to open it aslong as you have a keycard to open the door if needed and it isnt locked |
| Warden | A Facility guard able to see through the dark and flashbangs via pressing alt with a 5 second cooldown |

### READ BEFORE A BUG REPORT!!!
A) the ALT "keybind" for abilities is actually just your no clip key but is alt by default and not many people change that so theres no point in adding confusion with labeling it the "no clip key"
B) The command SSC (SetSubClass) will only work if you werent a subclass before using it (you can also die as a subclass then use the command perfectly fine)

### SubClass picking system
Each SubClass by default has a 50% chance of spawning and The maximum number of players that can be assigned it on round start is 1 (all adjustable in config)
